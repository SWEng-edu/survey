This repository contains supporting materials for the study: **"The Preparedness of Software Engineering Graduates: Perspectives from Academia and Industry"**

## Overview

This study explores the alignment between academic training and industry expectations regarding the readiness of software engineering graduates. Through a combination of qualitative analysis and stakeholder interviews, we investigate perceived gaps, skill priorities, and the evolving role of higher education in professional preparation.

## Contents

This repository provides supplementary materials used in our study, including representative examples from course assessment reports and the full set of in-depth interview questions used to explore skill gaps in software engineering education.

### Appendix A: Course Assessment Reports

It contains representative feedback examples from the final dataset, which includes 42,800 student feedback entries and 4,978 distinct faculty comments. These examples were selected after a rigorous filtering process and illustrate the depth of insights collected from both student and faculty perspectives.

### Appendix B: Skills Gap (RQ1)

It includes the full list of semi-structured interview questions used in our investigation of perceived skill gaps between academic training and industry expectations. Interviews were conducted with both recent graduates and experienced engineers, each lasting approximately 20 to 40 minutes. The questions are organized into five thematic dimensions, each containing 4â€“6 detailed prompts, facilitating structured yet flexible discussions. Tables II and III in the appendix present these interview questions.
